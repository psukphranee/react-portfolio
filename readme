-created a Projects section, now need to create Project cards to display in that section. use map() to render them
-after getting the structure right, move text and stuff to data.json
-sometime in the future, create a navbar
-after all sections complete, use browser router
-it feels better doing stuff from scratch. pick up ideas from tutorials.
-don't go back and forth. stick to the plan of creating a single page app with sections. start with the structure and stuff. then get into design. layer by layer.

It's been a minute. Where did I leave off? I don't think I've finished the tutorial video. 
Ok. So it looks like I did. Some parts of the video were skipped because I didn't want to include specific styling. The last part was including Responsive web design. I need to review and practice this. 
Learning from the tutorial is done. I will definitely need to review some parts but from now its just working on design/layout that I want.

Things to Modify (Desktop Version. Think about responsive design later):

    Navbar:
        -Phone number. xxxxxxx

    Intro Section:
        Change the profile picture.  xxxxxxxxx

    Projects:
        -Change to Machine Learning Projects xxxxxxxxx
        -Create slider for: MATLAB, Python Sci-Kit Learn, Tensorflow
            What should slider look like? 
            Create <ul> selector for each category. Style the <li>
    
    Portfolio:
        -Change Featured to "Front End"

    Contacts:
        -see whats up
        -name, email, message, submit
        -need to watch video
        -EmailJs
